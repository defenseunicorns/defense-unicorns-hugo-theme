# Bootstrap Go mod hack

This folder was added to work around a known bug in Go's module management. For details, please refer to:
[Go issue 37397](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37397)

Version: v.0.0.0 // x-release-please-version

This version is added to have something to update to force the release-please GitHub action to see a change in this
directory. The `release-dependencies.sh` script updates it.
